This project focuses on building a Sentiment Analysis model to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. It demonstrates the use of Machine Learning techniques along with Python programming to process, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from unstructured text data.

Key Tools & Technologies:
Machine Learning Algorithms: Implemented models like Naive Bayes for efficient sentiment classification.
Python Libraries: Utilized Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization, and sklearn for machine learning implementations.
Data Preprocessing: Included text normalization, stopword removal, tokenization, and feature extraction.
Explored and cleaned the IMDB movie reviews dataset to prepare data for analysis.
Applied machine learning workflows to classify textual data accurately.
Visualized dataset trends and model performance using Matplotlib.
Demonstrated the practical use of Python's sklearn library for implementing machine learning pipelines.
