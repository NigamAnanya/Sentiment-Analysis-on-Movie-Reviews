# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews  

This project demonstrates how to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as either **positive** or **negative** using **Machine Learning** techniques and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** workflows.

---

## Features  
- Implementation of **Machine Learning models** for sentiment classification.  
- Extensive **data preprocessing** to clean and prepare text data for analysis.  
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF** and **Bag-of-Words** techniques.  
- Visual analysis using **Matplotlib** for better insights into the dataset and model performance.

---

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: 
  - **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.  
  - **Matplotlib**: Visualizations of data and results.  
  - **sklearn**: Implementation of machine learning models and pipelines.  
- **Algorithms**: Naive Bayes for sentiment classification.

## Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Cleaned and normalized text data.  
   - Removed stopwords, tokenized sentences, and performed stemming/lemmatization.  

2. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Extracted features using **TF-IDF** and **Bag-of-Words** to convert text data into numerical form.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:  
   - Implemented **Naive Bayes** and evaluated performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Visualization**:  
   - Plotted trends and model evaluation results using **Matplotlib** for better interpretability.
